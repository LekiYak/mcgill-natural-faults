# Sample preparation
Lekima Yakuden (date)

## 1 Pre-processing
1. Label your sample using your initials (i.e. Fault from Alessandro V., scanned by Lekima Yakuden -> AVLY01, 02; Zabrisky Quartzite collected by Julia Baumgarte -> JBZQ01)
2. Scan entire slip surface using the (light?) scanner.
- If the surface is too large to scan in one go, scan overlapping segments of it and merge the resultant patches to generate a full surface. **Beware of artifacts generated during this stage as they can affect the analysis.**
3. Scan with the camera?
4. Do other things
