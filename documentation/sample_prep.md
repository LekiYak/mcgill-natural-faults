## 1 Pre-processing

1. Cut the sample using the rock saw if the surface *opposite* the slip surface doesn't rest more or less flat on a table. This is to improve the scan quality.
2. Label your sample using your initials (i.e. Fault from Alessandro V., scanned by Lekima Yakuden -> AVLY01, 02; Zabriskie Quartzite collected by Julia Baumgarte -> JBZQ01)
3. Scan entire slip surface using the (light?) scanner.
- If the surface is too large to scan in one go, scan overlapping segments of it and merge the resultant patches to generate a full surface. **Beware of artifacts generated during this stage as they can affect the analysis.**
4. Use the turntable setup to take photographs of your sample to create a 3D model of it using photogrammetry. About 100~200 photos should suffice.
- Guide on using the photogrammetry setup found in `photogrammetry.md`.

## 2 Resin Block Construction

1. Using styrofoam sheets and hot glue, construct an open-top box whose *inner dimensions* are as follows:
- 298 mm in length
- Wide enough to fit your sample, less than 298 mm in width
- Tall enough to allow for 30 mm of clearange, or one layer of gravel, between the top of the sample (slip surface down) and the top of the box

    Lable one of the shorter ends with a star. This end will align with the star on the direct shear apparatus (on the western side of the sample frames).
2. Place the sample slip surface down inside the box. The sample will be sheared as though moving away from the star, so ensure that the direction of slip is aligned opposite to the star, parallel to the long sides of the box. You can place a thin strip of duct tape, longer than the sample, along the slip direction to help in alignment.
3. Apply hot glue to the perimiter of the sample in contact with the bottom of the box, so as to seal off the slip surface. This is done to prevent silicone from flowing in under the sample. Make sure any fluid poured into the box will not touch the slip surface.
4. Prepare the silicone by mixing equal volumes of the **something** and **something** in a cup and mixing it with a popsicle stick (or whatever you want to use) for a couple of minutes. Once homogenized, pour the silicone into the box, ensuring that it is at least **x** mm deep. *Recommended:* reuse silicone bits from earlier experiments by placing them in the box and filling in the gaps with the liquid silicone. This step is to ensure clearance between the epoxy brick and the slip surface, so the former does not come into contact with the substrate during experiments.
- Wait a day for the silicone to harden.
